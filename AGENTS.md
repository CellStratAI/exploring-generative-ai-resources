## AUTONOMOUS AGENTS

1. **[A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous
Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11432.pdf)**  
Autonomous agents have long been a
research focus in academic and industry communities. Previous research often focuses on training
agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which diverges significantly from human
learning processes, and makes the agents hard to
achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through
the acquisition of vast amounts of web knowledge,
large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in human-level intelligence, leading to a surge in
research on LLM-based autonomous agents.
